# Database Issues: Fixed!

## Problem History & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing Column

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: user.is_admin
```

**Root Cause:** The database didn't have the `is_admin` column in the user table.

**Solutions:**

1. Fixed the database configuration in `config/config.py` to use the correct path.
2. Created scripts to fix the database:
   - `fix_database.py`: Creates a new database with proper schema and migrates data
   - `create_test_user.py`: Creates test users with correct password hashing

### Issue 2: Unable to Open Database

```
sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file
```

**Root Cause:** The application was looking for the database in different locations.

**Solutions:**

1. Updated Flask instance path handling in `__init__.py`:

   - Changed `DB_NAME` to include the instance folder
   - Modified `create_app()` to explicitly set the instance path
   - Updated the database path to use absolute paths

2. Updated database configuration in `config/config.py`:
   - Used absolute paths for the database URI: `sqlite:///{absolute_path}`
   - Made the path consistent across the application

## Diagnosis Tools

We created several helpful scripts to diagnose and fix database issues:

1. `check_db.py` - Examines database structure and contents
2. `simple_check.py` - Basic filesystem checks for database access
3. `check_app_config.py` - Verifies Flask application configuration
4. `test_app.py` - Tests database connectivity in the Flask app
5. `fix_init.py` - Updates Flask initialization to handle instance paths correctly

## Major Changes

1. **Configuration Updates**:

   - Changed database paths to use the instance folder consistently
   - Used absolute paths for reliability

2. **Instance Path Handling**:

   - Modified Flask application creation to explicitly set instance path
   - Ensured instance directory exists before database operations

3. **Database Schema Fixes**:
   - Created a new database with all required columns
   - Migrated existing user data to maintain accounts

## Preventative Measures

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Consider Using Flask-Migrate**:

   - Makes schema changes easier and more reliable
   - Automatically handles database upgrades

2. **Consistent Path Handling**:

   - Always use absolute paths for database URIs
   - Explicitly set Flask's instance path

3. **Database Backups**:
   - Keep regular backups of your database
   - The fix scripts created backups before making changes

## Conclusion

Both database issues have been successfully resolved. The application now:

1. Properly creates and accesses the database in the instance folder
2. Uses the correct schema with all required columns
3. Successfully connects to the database and reads/writes data

Your application should now run without any database-related errors!
