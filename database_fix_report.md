# Database Error Fix Report

## Initial Error

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: user.is_admin
[SQL: SELECT user.id AS user_id, user.email AS user_email, user.password AS user_password, user.first_name AS user_first_name, user.is_admin AS user_is_admin
FROM user
WHERE user.email = ?
 LIMIT ? OFFSET ?]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because:

1. The database file the application was trying to use didn't have the `is_admin` column in the user table
2. The configuration was pointing to the wrong database file or the database file was corrupted

## Solution Steps

### 1. Fixed Database Path Configuration

- Updated the database URI in `config/config.py` to consistently use the instance folder:
  ```python
  SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///instance/database.db'
  ```

### 2. Created Database Fix Utility

- Developed a script (`fix_database.py`) that:
  - Creates a backup of the existing database
  - Creates a new database with the correct schema including the `is_admin` column
  - Migrates existing user data from the backup
  - Creates a default admin user if no users were migrated

### 3. Fixed User Creation Script

- Updated `create_test_user.py` to use the default password hashing method instead of explicitly specifying 'sha256'
- This resolved the "Invalid hash method 'sha256'" error that occurred when creating users

## Results

- Successfully created a new database with the correct schema
- Successfully migrated the existing user data from the backup
- Database now has the `is_admin` column in the user table

## Next Steps

1. Try logging in to the application with your existing user credentials
2. Run the application with administrator privileges if you continue to encounter access issues
3. Keep the backup file in case you need to recover any additional data
4. Consider implementing Flask-Migrate for future database schema changes to avoid similar issues

## Emergency Recovery

If you encounter any issues with the new database, you can:

1. Use the `create_test_user.py` script to create a new user
2. Use the default admin credentials (if created):
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: admin123
3. Restore from the backup file: `instance/database.db.backup.[timestamp]`
