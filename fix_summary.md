# Database Issue Fix Summary

## The Problem

The application was throwing an error when trying to log in:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: user.is_admin
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `User` model in `models.py` has an `is_admin` column:

   ```python
   class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       email = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True)
       password = db.Column(db.String(150))
       first_name = db.Column(db.String(150))
       is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
   ```

2. However, the database configuration in `config/config.py` was pointing to a database file in the root directory:

   ```python
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///database.db'
   ```

3. Meanwhile, the actual database with user data was located in the `instance` folder, but the application was trying to use an empty database in the root directory.

## The Solution

1. We deleted the empty `database.db` file from the root directory.

2. We updated the database URI in `config/config.py` to point to the instance folder:

   ```python
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///instance/database.db'
   ```

3. We created a migration script (`migrate_data.py`) to copy any user data from the root database to the instance database, which would be useful if there was any data in the root database.

4. We also created a script (`add_admin_column.py`) to add the `is_admin` column to the user table if it doesn't exist, but we found that the column already existed in the instance database.

## Next Steps

1. Try logging in again - the error should be resolved.

2. Consider implementing a proper database migration system like Flask-Migrate to handle future database schema changes.

3. Keep the created scripts (`add_admin_column.py`, `check_db.py`, and `migrate_data.py`) for future reference or troubleshooting.
